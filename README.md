# miwokApp
An app that contains info about Miwok tribe so that the language can be taught to their descendants to restore their culure. 

This application is a work in progress and was built as a part of the Udacity course by Google (Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps).

It basically has Miwok words for different catogories like Colors, Family Members, Common Phrases, Numbers along with their English Translations.
